# rocket-stuff (very much WIP)

source code for NokiaOS (rocket operating system)
also a rocket interface for looking at data

dosnt work yet at all none of it 


# The flight computer
The code runs on a 2 core esp32-cam module.
I have choosen the esp32-cam because it has both a camera and a sd-card reader wich is very useful to save data and images.

On the esp32 i have soldered a BMP388 barometer to get altitude
There is also a GY-521 mpu accelerometer for speed, and stability data.

I am working on adding a XL1278-SMT 433hz radio module for in-flight communication
